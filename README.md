# Compare-two-similar-columns
This python code can be used to match elements in two rows which are similar but not exactly the same. Think of it like a v-lookup but it catches near matches too. 

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:  pandas , fuzzywuzzy, numpy, openpyxl 

This code is made with the help of Cursor AI. 

You will have to  edit excel file path, the column names, the variables for column names( not necessary but suggested to make sense of your code)and the destination file source.
